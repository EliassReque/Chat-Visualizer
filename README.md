# Chat-Visualizer: powerful data analysis toolkit
## What is it?
Our project offers the possibility of seeing exhaustive statistics, graphs and specific averages of your conversation with anyone. At the moment, our goal is to work with the exported files by users of WhatsApp conversations and later focus on other applications such as Instagram, telegram, twitter...etc. From our point of view, WhatsApp users will become more curious to explore, analyze and have more information regarding the conversation they make, it even works for those to whom it may concern to perform such analysis to whatever conversation they want, such as companies, medical researches or even for legal purposes, however, that's our vision for the future success of our project. For now, we are certain that our project makes it possible for the WhatsApp application to give a generally easy to interpret statistics.


## Main Features
Here are just a few of the things that chat-visualizer does well:

  - Timeline of the conversation
  - When and how many messages has each person sent in that period of time
  - General averages: words per message, characters per message, messages per day, letters per day, total number of messages from both parties
  - Graphs of previous data with evolution over time
  - Total number of multimedia content
  - Tops: most active day, first and last day of conversation, most used words
  - Conversation activity, represented in hours
